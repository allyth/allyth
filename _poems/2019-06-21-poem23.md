They undress their bodies <br>
So watch me <br>
Undress my mind <br>
<!-- split -->
The difference is <br>
The fake confidence <br>
The difference is <br>
The energy you attract<br>
The difference is <br>
One is easy<br>
The other brave<br>
The difference is <br>
When they run out of layers<br>
I will still be revealing dimensions <br>
.
