You try <br>
to simplify <br>
because my soul <br>
is so complex <br>

<!-- split -->

my mind has <br>
too many doors <br>
my words <br>
too many meanings <br>
my actions <br>
have a bigger purpose <br>
Overwhelmed,<br>
you step back <br>
and call me <br>
too serious <br>
too emotional <br>
crazy <br>
.
