                    <p>Hey! My name's Ally, I'm 16 years old, I am a high school student, and I live in the Chicago area. I love drawing, photography, and bowling. I started drawing/painting when I was about 6 years old and have been doing it ever since. My work was featured in Naperville Women's Club's Art Fair in 2015 and in the school's art fair. I have also been doing digital drawing/graphics since 2016 and I will focus more on it in the years to come.</p>
                    <p>I started photography in 2015 and really like it. You can check out my artwork (and not only) on this website as well as my Instagram page (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/strikingcolor/">@strikingcolor</a>).</p>
