While visting Europe, I hiked more than 9 miles in the Bucegi Mountains.

While some parts of the trail were challenging, the view was definitely worth it. I was surprised at how beautiful the weather was: slightly windy and cloudy, which was great for a comfortable hike. As we neared the end of the hike, it began to rain. Luckily, we got to our car before the rain picked up. It was definitely a lot better than a super sunny day, in my opinion. I can't wait to come back and discover more of the beautiful country of Romania.
