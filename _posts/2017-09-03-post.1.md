Besides traveling to some of my favorite places in Illinois during the 2017 summer (like state South Haven Beach in Michigan), I also got to meet new people and make new friends while volunteering for <a href="https://www.loaves-fishes.org/">Loaves & Fishes</a>.

 Not only did I have the chance to volunteer here and actually help through different activities, but I also got to collect and bring food in, along with the Youth Group of my local church. Here is a picture of us waiting to have the bags of food taken to be stored at Loaves and Fishes:
