For my Ap English class, we were asked to write a poem about the things we carry in our backpacks.
<!-- split -->
 Here is the poem:
  <br>
 <br>
 I carry
  <br>
  <br>
I carry a story 
 <br>
But my notebooks are filled with math problems and notes
 <br>
I carry mistakes
 <br>
A pencil to write and an eraser to erase them
 <br>
I carry a phone
 <br>
Yet I do not have many friends
 <br>
I carry a laptop
 <br>
The worldâ€™s information at my fingertips 
 <br>
Yet I know so little
 <br>
I carry a fragile bridge constructed out of single sticks of basswood
 <br>
Between aspects of my life
 <br>
I carry a small world
 <br>
But no one cares to notice
 <br>
 <br>
 In this poem, I not only included actual objects that I had in my backpack, but also intangible things that cannot be seen, yet I still carry.
