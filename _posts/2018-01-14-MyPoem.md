For my AP English class, we were asked to write a poem about the things we carry in our backpacks. Hope you enjoy it:

  <br>
 <h3>I carry</h3>
I carry a story 
 <br>
But my notebooks are filled with math problems and notes
 <br>
I carry mistakes
 <br>
A pencil to write and an eraser to erase them
 <br>
I carry a phone
 <br>
Yet I do not have many friends
 <br>
I carry a laptop
 <br>
The worldâ€™s information at my fingertips 
 <br>
Yet I know so little
 <br>
I carry a fragile bridge constructed out of single sticks of basswood
 <br>
Between aspects of my life
 <br>
I carry a small world
 <br>
But no one cares to notice
