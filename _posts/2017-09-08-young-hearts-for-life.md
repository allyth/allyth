In September 2017 I had the great opportunity of joining the Young Hearts for Life Junior Board.

Until today, with the help of their Heart Screening Program, over 175,000 teenagers benefited from a free ECG and hundreds were diagnosed and discovered heart dysfunctionalities and diseases that they had no idea they were suffering from. This wonderful program saved lives and is continuing to do so with the help of us and the people that truly care! The website is <a href="http://www.yh4l.org/">YH4L</a> ; you can join, support or donate.
