Along with SPOC volunteers, Sunday we raised money to buy boots and clothes for disadvantaged children in Romania. I am proud to have been part of this effort and I intend to participate in the future in any activities that could help other children to have a better life. It is amazing how such a small effort on our part has the potential to cause great joy for the less fortunate children.
