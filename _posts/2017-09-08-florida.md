In the Springbreak of 2017 my family and I took a trip to Florida and I had the chance to meet one of my father's friends and Tennis Director of Seven Bridges tennis club in Delray Beach. I thought it was very impressive to see a man who dedicated his life to this noble sport.

Meeting Mr. Pelmus is proof that if you continue to do something that you really love and enjoy, it can become a way of living and source of fulfillment for the rest of your life.
